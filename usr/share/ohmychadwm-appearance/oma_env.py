"""The system-wide GTK_THEME line in /etc/environment.

Kiro ships GTK_THEME there, and it beats every settings file for the GTK theme
in GTK 3 and GTK 4 apps. pam_env reads it at login, so changes show after a
re-login. Pure text transforms live here so they can be tested without root;
oma_root.py applies them to the real file.
